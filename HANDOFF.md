# CrispCalc — handover prompt

A self-contained briefing for the next assistant session. Treat
this as **load-bearing context**, not background reading: the
patterns below have been re-discovered (sometimes painfully) more
than once.

Always cross-check this file's claims against the current repo
state before recommending action — file names, APIs, and pins
rot fast. Where this file says "see X", actually open X.

## 0. State at end of 2026-05-26 session

Two parallel arcs landed today on top of the 2026-05-25 EOD
state — the user's Notepad/CSP/bug-fix arc + the AI assistant's
P9 3D-Scene arc. Both merged into `main` continuously throughout
the session (~20 commits per arc, frequent rebases). Read the
focused pickup note in `HANDOFF_NEXT.md` for the *next* steps;
this file remains the load-bearing pattern catalog.

**Main heads (verify with `git fetch && git log -1`):**

| Repo                       | Branch | Last shipped |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ------------ |
| CrispCalc                  | main   | `c8ccd6c` Round 91 (P6) precision-arc parser binding |
| symbolic_math_bridge       | main   | `505074d` round-90 factorint binding (unchanged today) |
| math-stack-ios-builder     | master | `34ec0fdf` round-90 fmpz_factor wrapper (unchanged) |
| dart_csp (pinned via pubspec) | main | `69a9cfb` (bumped 2026-05-26 — FlatZinc frontend + QuickXplain MUS) |

**What shipped this session (newest first):**

User's Notepad/CSP arc (see HANDOFF_NEXT.md for the full table):
- **Notepad Phases 4-8** — UI skeleton, live recalc, units +
  `use` directive, Markdown export + manager dialog, partial
  en/de/fr/es localization. Commits `b04caf1` through
  `95adf89`.
- **Bug rounds 1-2** — 100! exact integer (`27336ae`),
  decimal-places slider, auto-bind-solve toggle
  (`4fd26b6`), d/dx LaTeX alignment via `\bigg(` (`d82b285`
  through `cecc37c`), inline-derivative expansion
  (`1c00dc1`), history-cache GlobalKey crash fix
  (`642b913`).
- **182 new pure-Dart tests** across `parsing_pipeline_test`,
  `expression_pipeline_deep_test`, `edge_cases_test`, and
  the extended `csp_solver_test`. Caught + fixed 4 real
  preprocessor bugs (see HANDOFF_NEXT for the list).
- **CSP Gantt renderer** (`d664303`) — `noOverlap` /
  `cumulative` results now render as a horizontal Gantt
  chart.
- **PLAN entries** — CSP Round D (7 dart_csp opportunities,
  `aa0a390`) + Round E (FlatZinc + MUS + Notepad
  integration, `f4ee630`).

AI assistant's P9 3D-Scene arc (parallel, all merged into main):
- **R120** (`a755ae3`) — Calculator history LaTeX render
  cache. (Later patched by user in `642b913` to cache the
  *string* not the widget — see §4.13.)
- **R91** (`6276bbd`) — Right-click "Store result as
  variable / function" on Calculator history rows + Notepad
  result cells. Shared `StoreResultDialogs`.
- **R92 (P9-A1)** (`cae22d9`) — Scene engine scaffolding.
  Sealed `SceneObject` + 6 concrete kinds. Pure-Dart.
- **R93-R94 (P9-A2 + A3)** (`459e064`, `75a8e13`) — Scene
  screen + viewport; planes / lines / spheres rendering +
  add dialogs + drag-handle reorder.
- **R95 (P9-A4)** (`45ac048`) — Pairwise intersection
  engine (6 pairs) + cyan-highlighted overlay + results
  panel. 24 tests.
- **R96 (P9-A5)** (`bbc6511`) — Quadrics (preset-based: 6
  kinds — ellipsoid, cones, cylinders, paraboloid,
  hyperboloids). `QuadricPreset` derives the 10 canonical
  coefficients.
- **R97 (P9-A5b)** (`a6d42ee`) — Plane × quadric →
  `ConicSectionIntersection`. Painter does marching-squares
  on a 64×64 plane-local grid. Classification routes through
  the existing `analyzeConic`.
- **R98 (P9-A5c)** (`27b4dca`) — 3×3 determinant
  degenerate-conic detection on `conic_math.dart` (catches
  pair-of-parallel-lines that the discriminant alone
  misclassifies) + "Open in 3D Scene" button on
  `ConicSectionScreen` (lifts conic → matching quadric
  preset + adds z=0 plane + navigates).
- **R99 (P9-A6)** (`70efd9a`) — Parametric surfaces +
  curves. Process-static cache keyed by full geometry hash
  so rotation doesn't re-eval SymEngine.
- **R100 (R91b)** (`dfe5eb1`) — Naming-dialog polish:
  default suggestion + overwrite confirmation.

**Worktrees still on disk** (delete if not needed):

| Path                                                       | Branch | Status |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| `/Volumes/backups/code/CrispCalc-precision`                | `feat/precision-e-egamma-sqrt2` | obsolete after merge; safe to remove |
| `/Volumes/backups/code/CrispCalc-sudoku-ui`                | various (latest: P9 + polish branches) | reusable for any CrispCalc round |
| `/Volumes/backups/code/CrispCalc-notepad-phase-1`          | `feature/notepad-phase-1` | user's active arc; leave alone |
| `/Volumes/backups/code/symbolic_math_bridge-precision`     | various | reusable for future bridge changes |
| `/Users/christianstrobele/code/math-stack-ios-builder-precision` | various | reusable for wrapper changes |

**Symlink in place** at `/Volumes/backups/code/math-stack-ios-builder`
→ `/Users/christianstrobele/code/math-stack-ios-builder-precision`
so the bridge's `copy_xcframeworks.sh` finds xcframework outputs
in the precision worktree. Repoint if you switch math-stack
worktrees.

**Tests at session end**: 1780 (1708 → 1780 across Round E.1 + E.2
+ E.3 + E.4-inline + Round 91 precision-arc binding). All green;
CI 6-job matrix on every main push.

**Working mode change (2026-05-26 EOD)**: parallel-arc work is paused.
All edits now go directly on `main` in `/Volumes/backups/code/CrispCalc`.
The existing feature-branch worktrees (`CrispCalc-csp-e`,
`CrispCalc-notepad-phase-1`, `CrispCalc-round-91`, `CrispCalc-precision`,
`CrispCalc-sudoku-ui`) stay on disk as reference but their `build/` +
`.dart_tool/` were trimmed (~635 MB reclaimed). `flutter pub get` +
`flutter build` will regenerate them if anyone needs to resume work
on a side branch.

---

## 0a. Worktree discipline (now superseded — see §0 working-mode change)

**Until 2026-05-26 EOD this said: all edits through feature-branch
worktrees, never on main directly.** That rule was paused — the user
disabled the parallel worker and asked for direct work on main.
The rest of this section is kept as reference for if/when parallel
arcs resume.

**Old convention**: all edits through feature-branch worktrees,
never on main/master directly. Established when the precision arc
started directly on main in all three repos (round 85) and caused a
near-miss when I misread the main worktree's truncated diff state.
Saved as a memory entry under
`~/.claude/projects/-Volumes-backups-code-CrispCalc/memory/`.

### The pattern

For every round, in every repo touched by the round:

```bash
cd <repo>
git worktree add ../<repo>-<arc-name> -b feat/<arc-name>
# … edit in the new worktree …
cd ../<repo>-<arc-name>
git add … && git commit -m "..."
git push -u origin feat/<arc-name>
# When CI is green and tests pass, merge:
cd ../<repo>
git fetch origin
git merge --ff-only feat/<arc-name>   # rebase first if main moved
git push origin main
```

### Why this matters here

The user works in parallel — main moves under you. When you
come back to merge, you'll often find:

- `git status` in the main worktree shows uncommitted changes
  the user is working on. **Don't push from main.**
- `git log origin/main..main` shows the user pushed commits
  you didn't make. **Rebase the feature branch onto current
  main before merging.**
- The user has the same main checked out (via the main
  worktree); your edits don't show up there until you push.

### Quick reference

| Action | Where |
| ------ | ----- |
| Read code, run tests, plan rounds | any worktree |
| Edit code for a new round | new feature-branch worktree |
| Commit + push | the feature-branch worktree |
| `flutter analyze` / `flutter test` / `flutter build` | the feature-branch worktree |
| `git merge --ff-only` + `git push origin main` | the main worktree |
| Delete an obsolete worktree | `git worktree remove <path>` |

### Don't push from main

Main worktree often has the user's uncommitted work-in-progress.
Pushing from main would either drag their uncommitted state into
the commit or silently lose it. Always commit + push from a
feature-branch worktree; only do `git merge --ff-only +
git push origin main` from main, and check `git status` first.

## 1. What the app is

CrispCalc — Flutter CAS calculator, multi-platform (macOS / iOS /
Android / Linux / Windows, debug via `flutter run -d <device>`).

The codebase has grown well past "calculator":

- Calculator screen with hardware-keyboard + on-screen keypad
- Graphing (2D + 3D)
- Analysis hub with 9 module cards (Curve Sketching, Planes, Conic
  Sections, Statistics, 3D Graphing, Unit Converter, Constants,
  Constraint problems, Sudoku)
- Constraint Satisfaction Problems via [dart_csp](../dart_csp):
  Diophantine, cryptarithms, free-form DSL editor (with
  `minimize` / `maximize` / `noOverlap` directives), Sudoku
  (Regular / Sudoku-X / Killer / Disjoint Groups; 4×4 / 6×6 /
  8×8 / 9×9 / 16×16)
- Worked-examples library (~30 curated entries) — discovery
  surface that crosses into the module screens via sentinel
  expressions (see §5.2)
- Settings: locale (en/de/fr/es), themes, number format,
  user-defined functions

Native code under `symbolic_math_bridge` plugin handles SymEngine;
`dart_csp` is a pure-Dart CSP engine.

## 2. Working style

The user runs **round-based development**: each shippable feature
or fix is a self-contained commit, pushed individually. Common
flow:

1. User picks a task ("ok do it") from a 3-4 item recommendation
2. You implement: engine code → widget code → i18n across 4
   locales → tests
3. Run `flutter analyze` + `flutter test` + `dart format` (all
   must be clean)
4. Update `HISTORY.md` with a round entry describing **why** and
   **what**
5. Commit + push (commits already trigger CI)
6. User offers next pick

### Commit message style

```
P5: <short feature> — <subtitle>

<2-3 paragraph why-and-what body. Concrete: "moved X from Y to Z
because Q". Reference specific files and round numbers when fixing
regressions. End with the Co-Authored-By trailer:>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

The `P5:` prefix groups long-running phases. `fix:` / `ci:` for
non-feature commits.

### User preferences (calibrated over many rounds)

- **Terse responses** — short sentences, no trailing recap, no
  emoji unless explicitly requested
- **No spontaneous markdown docs** — only create *.md files when
  explicitly asked (this file was)
- **Root-cause fixes, not patches** — when something recurs ("we
  fix this time and again"), find the systemic cause. Spot fixes
  are explicitly criticized.
- **Don't claim work that wasn't done** — `pkill -f "flutter run"`
  kills the wrapper, not the compiled app. Verify, don't assume.
- **You can't send keystrokes to backgrounded processes** —
  `run_in_background: true` has no stdin. To hot-reload, you have
  to kill + restart.
- **i18n is non-negotiable** — every user-visible string goes
  through `AppLocalizations` with en/de/fr/es translations. The
  locale-coverage test in `test/localizations_test.dart` enforces.

### Recently shipped (read HISTORY for context)

- **Round 73** — Sudoku advanced hints (SAC by probing)
- **Round 74** — CSP DSL `minimize` / `maximize`
- **Round 75** — Sudoku 8×8 layout (2×4 boxes)
- **Round 76** — Sudoku Disjoint Groups variant
- **Round 77** — CSP DSL `noOverlap` (single-machine scheduling)
- **Round 78** — DSL linear parser accepts expressions on both
  sides of the comparator
- **Round 79** — worked-examples library surfaces the round-74
  and round-77 DSL gallery entries (`coinChangeMin`,
  `schedulingMakespan`); PLAN.md + this file synced
- **Round 80** — CSP DSL `cumulative(s1=2@2, ...; capacity=N)`
  — renewable-resource generalization of round 77's `noOverlap`;
  closes the round-E bundle
- **Round 81** — Sudoku visualizer step-trace constraint-context
  captions (row / col / box / cage / diagonal / disjoint group)
- **Round 82** — 8×8 Sudoku variant presets (X / Disjoint /
  Killer) on the round-75 2×4-box layout
- **Round 83** — 10×10 / 12×12 / 15×15 Sudoku layouts + medium
  presets; same parameterized engine, no per-size code paths
- **Round 84** — multi-resource RCPSP gallery entry; two parallel
  `cumulative` overlays (crew + equipment) for project scheduling
- **Round 85** — Precision arc round 1: `pi(N)` via MPFR through
  the three-repo pipeline (math-stack-ios-builder → bridge →
  CrispCalc). First multi-repo feature-branch arc; see
  `HANDOFF_PRECISION.md` for the next slices.
- **Round 86** — Precision arc round 2: `e(N)`, `EulerGamma(N)`,
  `sqrt(2,N)` via the same pipeline. Boilerplate factored into
  a wrapper-side macro + bridge-side `_callPrecisionFn` helper.
- **Round 87** — Sudoku UI overhaul: clue-overwrite bug fix,
  layout-switch auto-loads matching preset, solve auto-plays
  the visualizer, visualizer-overflow → `Wrap`, drag-and-drop
  digits, cell-keyboard input + arrow nav, clear-to-start
  button, win-check chip.
- **Round 87b** — Sudoku win-celebration overlay (animated
  scale-in card with check icon + tap-to-dismiss) replaces the
  tiny win chip as the primary "you won" signal.
- **Round 88** — Sudoku conflict highlighting: pure-Dart
  `computeConflicts` flags every cell participating in a
  row/col/box/diagonal/disjoint-group/cage duplicate or a
  fully-filled cage with mismatched sum. Cells render with a
  22% red wash. Plus 8×8 X/Disjoint uniqueness audit (both
  pass — no regen needed).
- **Round 89** — Precision arc round 3: `isprime` + `nextprime`
  + `prevprime` via three new C wrappers. isprime/prevprime
  use GMP's `mpz_probab_prime_p` directly (SymEngine's cwrapper
  only exposes nextprime); nextprime goes through
  `ntheory_nextprime`. Same three-repo pipeline.
- **Round 90** — Precision arc round 4: `factorint(n)` via
  FLINT's `fmpz_factor`. First FLINT-backed wrapper. Output
  format `"p1^e1*p2^e2*..."` parsed Dart-side to structured
  `(prime, exponent)` records. 90-bit input cap. Nine new
  FLINT externs added to the +load keepalive.
- **Round 91 follow-up** — Matrix self-test tile gated behind
  `kDebugMode` in `main.dart:597`. Developer diagnostic; not
  for end users. CI / scripted runs still reach the same
  battery via the `CRISPCALC_DIAGNOSTIC=matrix` env-var hook
  at startup.
- **Docs P6 / P7 / P8 (no round numbers)** — 565 lines of
  PLAN.md added: discoverability + help-system overhaul (P6,
  rounds 91-105), boolean type + relational/logical operators
  (P7, rounds 110-114), Calculator history performance hot
  spots (P8, rounds 120-124). Read §6 here + PLAN.md before
  picking the next round.

## 4. Land mines we have already hit

### 4.1 dart_csp pin can vanish (force-push)

`pubspec.yaml` git-pins `dart_csp` to a SHA. The upstream remote
sometimes force-pushes / rewrites history. When the pinned SHA no
longer exists, **CI fails on `pub get` with "Could not find a file
named pubspec.yaml"** even though everything works locally (the
pub cache still has the old SHA).

Fix: `gh api repos/CrispStrobe/dart_csp/commits/main --jq .sha`,
update `ref:` in pubspec.yaml, `flutter pub get`, full test sweep
(the API may have shifted), commit + push.

See commit `c39dfd3`.

### 4.2 dart_csp GAC propagator pathology

dart_csp's generalized-arc-consistent allDifferent propagator
**prunes valid solutions when two allDifferent constraints share
the same variable subset**. Hit by Killer Sudoku in round 64
where every cage's allDifferent was being added redundantly even
when the cage was entirely within one row/column/box (already
covered by the existing row/col/box allDifferent).

Workaround in `lib/engine/sudoku.dart` `_buildProblem`: detect
when a cage's cells share a row, column, or box, and SKIP the
cage allDifferent in that case. The cage sum (`addLinearEquals`)
is always added.

Regression test:
`test/sudoku_test.dart` → `regression: horizontal-only cage does
not over-constrain the solver`.

If this comes back, **don't remove the regression test**. The
upstream bug isn't fixed; our workaround is what makes Killer
work at 9×9.

### 4.3 Calculator keyboard focus root cause

The calculator's hardware-keyboard input has been "fixed" several
times via spot patches (HardwareKeyboard reset button,
postFrameCallback refocus, etc.). Root cause was finally addressed
in round 71: focus restoration only fired on tab switch
(`_select(i)` in main.dart), so any **pushed route popping back**
(dialog, module screen, anything) left focus stranded.

Fix: app-wide `RouteObserver` in `main.dart` registered on
`MaterialApp.navigatorObservers`, plus `RouteAware` mixin on
`CalculatorScreenState` with `didPopNext()` re-requesting the
calculator FocusNode.

**If focus regresses again, check `appRouteObserver` is still
wired and `CalculatorScreenState.didPopNext()` still calls
`_calculatorFocusNode.requestFocus()` before patching anything.**

### 4.4 Right-panel overflow on narrow Sudoku screen

The Sudoku right panel is `SizedBox(width: 360)` at the wide
breakpoint. Several widgets break this width:

- `SegmentedButton` with 3+ labeled segments — replaced with
  `ChoiceChip` + `Wrap` (see `_SizeVariantPickers`)
- `DropdownButtonFormField` with long preset labels — use
  `isExpanded: true` + `TextOverflow.ellipsis` on each item's
  Text
- The whole `controlsBlock` Column — wrap in
  `SingleChildScrollView` for the wide layout (narrow already
  uses ListView)

The regression test
`test/ui_flows_test.dart` → `Sudoku screen: variant switcher
cycles without DropdownButton crash` catches both the dropdown
crash AND the overflow. Round 76 extended the variant rotation
in that test to include Disjoint — keep all four variants in
the cycle when adding more.

### 4.5 DropdownButton "exactly one item" assertion

`DropdownButtonFormField<T>` asserts that its `initialValue` is in
the `items` list. The preset picker constructs items from
`SudokuPresets.all` but `_puzzle` can be a freshly-constructed
empty puzzle (from variant/layout switch) that ISN'T identical to
any preset. **Pass `null` for `initialValue` when no preset
matches by identity** (renders as no-selection — "Custom"). Don't
fall back to `current`.

### 4.6 Killer 9×9 uniqueness is hard

Round 64 shipped a "feasible but not unique" killer9x9 preset
(horizontal-only cages). Round 66 replaced it with a "47 cages,
13 singleton clues + greedy 2-cell pairs" layout that's
provably unique. The high singleton count is what bought
uniqueness — generating a 9×9 Killer with FEWER singletons
needs a search loop over cage shapes (V2, see PLAN).

If you ship a new Killer preset, **add a `hasUniqueSolution`
test** so a future "improvement" can't silently break
uniqueness.

### 4.7 Test pollution from AppState singleton

`AppState` is a singleton — pending-X slots survive across
widget tests in the same isolate. Widget tests that touch
pending slots should drain them (or `AppState().load(force:
true)` at the start). The `_pumpApp` helper in `ui_flows_test.dart`
does this.

### 4.8 `__obj__` is a reserved variable name in DSL optimization

`solveOptimization` injects a synthetic `__obj__` range variable
to carry the objective value (dart_csp's `minimize` / `maximize`
require the objective to be a registered variable). The DSL
checks `knownVars.contains('__obj__')` up front and rejects the
program with a friendly error if a user-declared variable
collides.

If a refactor changes the synthetic name (or its bounding
linear-equals constraint), **keep the collision check in sync**.
The bound is computed from input-variable ranges as
`Σ min(coef*lo, coef*hi)` and `Σ max(coef*lo, coef*hi)` plus any
constant offset in the objective expression — this matters
because dart_csp picks its interval-vs-list domain rep based on
span, and an open-ended range balloons the search.

### 4.9 `_parseLinearTerms` returns null for constant-only expressions

Round 78 extended `_tryParseLinear` (CSP) to handle
expression-on-both-sides, but **`addLinearEquals` requires a
non-empty variable list** — so when LHS and RHS cancel out to
zero variables (`5 == 5`, `x - x == 0`), the helper deliberately
returns null and falls through to dart_csp's string parser.
Don't "fix" the empty-list early return — the fallback is
correct, and dart_csp validates the constant comparison
correctly.

Regression test: `test/csp_solver_test.dart` →
`constant-only constraints still fall through to the string
parser`.

### 4.10 DSL gallery vs. worked-examples discovery — keep in sync

The `dsl:<id>` sentinel pattern (round 73) requires two places
to stay aligned when adding a new gallery program:

1. `_DslTabState._gallery` in `lib/screens/constraints_screen.dart`
   — the program text users actually load
2. `WorkedExamples.all` in `lib/engine/worked_examples.dart` —
   the discovery entry that surfaces the program in the
   worked-examples dialog
3. `AppLocalizations.workedExampleTitle/Description` for
   en/de/fr/es (titles are localised per id; English fallback
   comes from the entry itself)
4. `constraintsDslExampleTitle` in app_localizations.dart for
   the Examples-button dropdown inside the DSL tab

The `test/worked_examples_test.dart` →
`round 73: dsl: sentinels target known gallery ids` test
catches typos in (1) vs (2), but **all four touch-points are
needed for full discoverability**. Round 79 surfaced the
round-74 (`coinChangeMin`) and round-77 (`schedulingMakespan`)
entries that had previously only been in the gallery — keep
new entries from drifting again. Round 80 added
`cumulativeScheduling` through this same four-point pattern.

### 4.11 `cumulative` body parses by splitting on `;` — exactly two segments

Round 80 syntax is `cumulative(<tasks>; capacity=N)`. The parser
splits the inner body on `;` and requires *exactly two* segments
— a missing `; capacity=N` clause is a friendly rejection, not a
silent fallback. If someone tries to support more than one
`capacity=N` clause (multi-resource per-overlay) they have to
choose another separator or another keyword — don't relax the
exact-2 check; the malformed-input tests rely on it.

The task-pair regex requires `name=duration@demand` (the `@` is
literal, not optional). Don't let a future "convenience"
fallback to `name=duration` silently treat the demand as 1 —
that overloads what `noOverlap(...)` is for and makes the parser
ambiguous. Keep `cumulative` strict.

### 4.12 dart_csp's `CspCallback` doesn't carry constraint identity

`Problem.setOptions(callback: ...)` (dart_csp/lib/src/problem.dart:205)
takes a `CspCallback(assigned, unassigned)` and fires on every
decision. It does NOT include which constraint propagated — the
propagators don't emit names. Anything that claims "dart_csp's
propagation callback fires per decision with constraint
identity" is wrong (HANDOFF.md §6 made this mistake before
round 81 shipped).

Two options if you need firing-constraint identity:
1. Extend dart_csp's callback signature (multi-repo change +
   repin)
2. Infer post-hoc from the pre/post-state diff (lossy — many
   constraints can produce the same prune)

Round 81 sidestepped this entirely by showing constraint
*context* (which overlays the assigned cell participates in)
rather than constraint *identity* (which propagator fired). See
`SudokuPuzzle.contextAt`.

### 4.13 Cache the LaTeX *string*, not the `Math.tex` widget

Round 120 cached `Math.tex(...)` widget instances per-expression
to speed up history-list rebuilds when toggling ASCII↔LaTeX.
**This broke** the moment the same expression appeared twice in
history: `Math.tex` constructs an internal `GlobalKey` per
instance, and Flutter refuses to mount the same `GlobalKey`
twice. User shipped the fix in `642b913` — cache the LaTeX
*source string* (cheap; result of `MathDisplayUtils
.toHistoryDisplayLatex`) and rebuild the widget per call site.
Apply this pattern to any future widget caches: if the widget
holds a `GlobalKey`, cache its input instead.

### 4.14 Append new Analysis-hub module cards at the end

`ui_flows_test.dart`'s Sudoku tests do
`scrollUntilVisible(find.text('Sudoku'), 200)` then `tap` at the
1280×800 test viewport. Inserting a new `_ModuleCard` *above*
Sudoku pushes the card just past the visible region; the
`scrollUntilVisible` scrolls to bring it into view but the
subsequent `tap` re-measures and fires below the viewport
(the warning is `Offset ... would not hit test on the
specified widget`). P9-A2 originally placed the 3D Scene card
next to Planes and broke 3 Sudoku tests; fixed by appending the
new card at the end. If you add another hub card, append unless
you also update the tests' scroll expectations.

### 4.15 `analyzeConic` discriminant alone misclassifies pair-of-lines

`Δ = B² − 4AC = 0` matches both **parabolas** and the
**degenerate pair of parallel lines** (e.g. `x² − 1 = 0`).
Round A5c added a 3×3 determinant pre-check on the full form
matrix `M3 = [[A, B/2, D/2], [B/2, C, E/2], [D/2, E/2, F]]`:
`det(M3) == 0 ⇒ degenerate`; otherwise the discriminant
classifies ellipse/circle/parabola/hyperbola. The plane×cylinder
case in `scene_3d_intersections_test.dart` exercises this. If
you ever simplify the classifier, preserve this check or the
regression resurfaces.

### 4.16 Parametric scene rendering needs the per-process cache

Painting a 18×18 parametric surface samples 324 expressions per
frame via `CalculatorEngine.evaluateForGraphing`. Without
caching, each rotation gesture re-evaluates the whole grid and
the viewport lags visibly. `_ParametricSampleCache` in
`scene_3d_painter.dart` keys by the full geometry hash
(expression strings + ranges + steps), FIFO-evicts at 32
entries. User-edits change the cache key so stale entries roll
off. **Load-bearing**: removing the cache makes the module feel
broken; keep it.

### 4.17 dart-format reflow conflicts with parallel user WIP

When the AI assistant runs `dart format lib/` on a feature
branch, the formatter touches files the user is actively editing
in the main worktree (calculator_screen.dart, latex_conversion_
utils.dart). After rebase onto origin/main, those format-only
diffs collide with the user's substantive edits. The clean
workaround used 3× this session: `git checkout origin/main --
<file>` to revert the format-only diff on files you didn't
intentionally edit, before commit. Or, format only the files
you actually touched.

## 5. Cross-screen + cross-feature patterns worth knowing

### 5.1 AppState pending slots

For "one screen wants another to do X on its next mount", use a
nullable field on `AppState` + setter + one-shot consumer.
Examples:

- `pendingInsertExpression` / `requestInsertExpression(s)` /
  `consumePendingInsert()` — calculator slot
- `pendingDslProgramId` / `requestLoadDslProgram(id)` /
  `consumePendingDslProgramId()` — Constraints/Free-form slot

Don't notifyListeners() from the consumer (you're already inside
a listener callback when you drain).

### 5.2 Sentinel `expression` field on WorkedExample

Worked examples were originally "tap → insert this string into the
calculator". Two sentinel prefixes extend that:

- `open:<module>` — navigate to a module screen (sudoku,
  constraints)
- `dsl:<gallery_id>` — navigate to Constraints + Free-form tab,
  pre-load the program from `_DslTabState._gallery`

Detection is in `lib/widgets/worked_examples_dialog.dart`
`_insert()`. Catalog-side validation tests in
`test/worked_examples_test.dart` enforce that every sentinel
points at a real target — a typo in a future entry fails CI
rather than silently dead-ending.

### 5.3 Singleton arc consistency by probing (when AC-3 isn't exposed)

Round 73 needed "stricter than naive pencil-marks" for Sudoku
hints. dart_csp doesn't expose a propagate-to-fixpoint entry
point (its `_propagate` is private; `Problem` only offers full
`getSolution` / `getSolutions`), so we can't ask for "the
reduced domain after AC-3 + GAC."

The workaround: for each candidate value `v` at empty cell `c`,
build `puzzle.withCell(c, v)` and call the full solver. If it's
satisfiable, keep `v`; otherwise drop it. This is singleton arc
consistency by probing — semantically what AC-3 gives you for
unary constraints, but routed through the backtracker.

Two short-circuits keep it bounded:

- Fetch one base solution up front. Each cell's base value is
  trivially feasible, so skip the probe for it.
- Every successful probe returns a *different* complete
  solution; harvest its per-cell values into a `confirmed` set
  so subsequent (cell, value) pairs already proven feasible
  skip the probe.

`SudokuSolver.computeCandidatesPruned` lives in
`lib/engine/sudoku.dart`. The UI gates this behind an
"Advanced" hint level (off / basic / advanced) because the cost
is seconds-per-edit on hard 9×9 puzzles. A monotonic
`_advancedRequestId` in the screen state cancels stale
in-flight results when the user edits quickly.

If you need the same pattern for a different CSP, reuse the
shape: naive set → base solution → per-candidate probe →
harvest. Don't try to expose dart_csp internals — the probe
loop is robust and the cost is bearable for any problem the
backtracker handles quickly.

### 5.4 Synthetic objective variable for `minimize` / `maximize`

dart_csp's `Problem.minimize(objective)` /
`Problem.maximize(objective)` take the **name of a variable**,
not an expression. To optimize a linear expression like
`x + 2y - z`, round 74 introduced a synthetic `__obj__` range
variable bound to that expression via `addLinearEquals`:

```dart
problem.addRangeVariable('__obj__', objLo, objHi);
problem.addLinearEquals(
  [...exprVars, '__obj__'],
  [...exprCoeffs, -1],
  -constantTerm,   // round 78: any +k in the objective folds here
);
final result = await problem.minimize('__obj__');
```

The tight `(objLo, objHi)` range matters — dart_csp picks
interval-vs-list domain rep based on span. Compute it from the
input-variable ranges (per-term min/max contribution summed
independently). If you forget and use a huge range, the search
balloons.

After the solver returns, strip `__obj__` from the assignment
before handing back to the caller — see `solveOptimization` in
`csp_solver.dart`. The optimum value is `result['__obj__']`.

### 5.5 Scene3D module shape (P9, May 2026)

The 3D Scene module factors cleanly into three layers; replicate
when adding another renderable kind:

1. **Engine** (`lib/engine/scene_3d/`):
   - Add a new `SceneObject` subclass with `toJson` / `fromJson`
     and `equalsByGeometry`. Wire into the dispatch in
     `SceneObject.fromJson`.
   - Add an `Intersection` algorithm + dispatch case in
     `intersections.dart` for any new pair you support.
   - All pure-Dart; tests live next to other engine tests.
2. **Painter** (`lib/widgets/scene_3d_painter.dart`):
   - Dispatch in the `switch (obj)` block inside `paint`. The
     `project(x, y, z)` closure carries the rotation +
     orthographic projection — every renderer reuses it.
   - For intersection overlays: add a case to the
     `for (final result in intersections)` switch.
3. **UI** (`lib/widgets/scene_3d_object_dialogs.dart` +
   `lib/screens/scene_3d_screen.dart`):
   - Add a `show...EditorDialog` function returning the new
     object on save.
   - Wire into `_showAddSheet` (FAB chooser), `_editObject`
     (edit dispatch), `_toggleVisibility` (the rebuilder that
     constructs a copy with flipped `visible`), and
     `_subtitleFor` (panel description).

The viewport rotation/zoom state lives on `Scene3D` (azimuth,
elevation, zoom, range) and persists via AppState. Don't add a
parallel viewport-state field on the screen.

## 6. Open arcs, ranked by lift vs. cost

### Top of queue (post 2026-05-26 EOD)

Both arcs from the May-25 EOD have shipped (Round 120, Round
91 + 91b, plus the entire P9 module — see HANDOFF_NEXT.md for
the round table). What's left:

1. **CSP Round E — FlatZinc + MUS** (user's pickup, has the
   most momentum). Bump `dart_csp` pin to a HEAD SHA that
   includes both the FlatZinc frontend (`8520461`) and the
   QuickXplain MUS (`66b1a31` + `47beb59` + `a483980`); then
   E.1 (Paste-FlatZinc tab) → E.4 (Notepad ↔ FlatZinc).
   PLAN.md → search `CSP Round E`. HANDOFF_NEXT.md has the
   ordered recipe.
2. **Round 110 — Booleans (P7).** Calculator preprocessor:
   `a == b` → `Eq(a, b)`, `a and b` → `And(a, b)`, etc.
   `true`/`false` render as colored chips in history.
   PLAN P7 has the full 5-round breakdown.
3. **P9 follow-ups** (the 3D Scene module is V1-complete but
   has three deferred polish rounds):
   - **A5d** — Raw-coefficient quadric input + painter
     isosurface extraction. Pre-req if the user wants to
     paste a 10-coeff quadric without using a preset.
   - **A7** — Numerical intersection involving parametric
     objects (Newton on a fine grid).
   - **A8** — Back-to-front sorting for proper occlusion.
     Cosmetic for now: the back hemisphere of a sphere draws
     over the front when seen edge-on.
4. **P6 — Discoverability + help (15-round arc, mostly
   untouched).** The notepad arc and the 3D Scene arc both
   made parts of P6 less load-bearing (the new module IS
   discoverable from the hub; the user-side bug-fix round
   touched some of the keypad surface). Re-read P6 with
   fresh eyes before committing to it as the next strategic
   direction.

### Bigger strategic next: discoverability + help (P6, rounds 91-105)

PLAN P6 lays out a 15-round roadmap to fix CrispCalc's
information architecture:

- Move Worked Examples out of Settings into a `(?)` icon on
  Calculator + Notepad.
- New Function Reference dialog (operator dictionary: ~50
  entries × 4 locales).
- App-wide help-mode `(?)` overlay system; tap any button /
  cell / history row / notepad line for an inline explanation
  of "how was this computed?"
- Precision-arc + ntheory surfacing in the parsers + Adv
  keypad (rounds 91-92 of P6 specifically).

This is the strategic mid-term direction. Each round is
single-session, shippable independently, testable in CI.

### Continuing the precision arc (HANDOFF_PRECISION.md)

`HANDOFF_PRECISION.md` is the load-bearing doc for the
precision-arc work. After rounds 85/86/89/90 it covers
4 MPFR constants + 3 ntheory primitives + factorint. Still
on the menu: `modpow` / `modinv` / `totient` / `jacobi`
(round 4 of HANDOFF_PRECISION). Smaller and well-trodden
now — the three-repo pipeline + +load keepalive + 9-extern
FLINT extension are all proven.

### Other arcs (multi-session, deferred)

1. **dart_csp propagation-callback identity** — round 81
   shipped constraint-*context* captions; the next tightening
   would expose **which** propagator actually fired through
   dart_csp's `CspCallback`. Multi-repo.
2. **Irregular-region Sudoku (Du-sum-oh)** — polyomino
   tilings instead of rectangular boxes.
3. **Killer generator V2** — programmatic cage-layout
   generation with uniqueness guarantee.
4. **Worked-examples V3** — related rates, eigenvalue,
   multivariable, parametric + step-by-step jump.
5. **AI copilot (P5 Strategic Next)** — verifier-frontend
   only. Job 1 (translate prose → engine syntax) is the
   smallest viable shipping unit. Not started.

The strategic adds from PLAN.md's May-2026 Strategic Context
(notepad / document input paradigm + AI as verifier-frontend)
sit above the menu strategically. The **notepad work is
mostly shipped now** (Phase 1-8 landed across the two sessions);
the AI copilot work hasn't started.

### Format-fix recurring debt

**Four CI format-check failures this session** — every
notepad push has dragged dart-format issues into main, each
requiring a follow-up CI: dart format commit. There's now an
opt-in pre-commit hook at `tools/hooks/pre-commit` that runs
`dart format --set-exit-if-changed lib/ test/` and
`flutter analyze` locally. Enable with:

```
git config core.hooksPath tools/hooks
```

If a future session sees a fifth+ format-fix follow-up,
consider proactively suggesting the hook again, or making it
opt-out (auto-enable from a one-time `flutter pub get` hook).

## 7. Critical commands

```bash
# Run-and-iterate
flutter run -d macos              # dev build (debug, hot reload)
flutter analyze                   # must be clean before commit
flutter test                      # full suite; expect ~1708 tests, ~1 min
dart format <files>               # CI runs format check on pinned Dart toolchain

# CI
gh run list --limit 6             # latest workflow runs (6 jobs per push)
gh run view <id> --log-failed     # failure details for a specific run

# Investigation
grep -rn "<symbol>" lib/          # codebase search (prefer over Agent for known files)
git log -p --grep="<keyword>"     # previous fixes for similar issues
```

CI runs 6 jobs on every push: CI (test + analyze) + Build
{macOS, Linux, Windows, Android, iOS}. All must pass.

## 8. Self-update protocol

If something in this file is wrong by the time you read it,
**fix it as part of your first commit in the session**, don't
work around it. Stale handover docs cause future regressions.

Specifically:
- Test count drifts as features land — update §3's "~1708 tests"
  and §7's "expect ~1708 tests". Adding a WorkedExample entry
  auto-generates 6 tests (3 non-EN locales × title + description)
  via `worked_examples_localization_test.dart`, so the count can
  jump even on docs-only rounds.
- Pin SHA in §0's main-heads table changes on every dart_csp
  repin — update the commit ref. Current pin `69a9cfb` (bumped
  2026-05-26 to a HEAD that carries the FlatZinc frontend + the
  QuickXplain MUS; smoke-tested by the full 1708-test suite).
- Lessons from new rounds belong in §4 as new sub-sections;
  cross-cutting patterns belong in §5.
- §6 is the moving part — strike completed picks, surface new
  ones discovered while shipping.
- `HANDOFF_NEXT.md` is the **single-session pickup note**;
  refresh / rewrite it at the end of each session for what the
  next assistant should pick up first. This file (HANDOFF.md)
  is the **longer-lived pattern catalog**.

Newest-first round entries continue to live in `HISTORY.md`.
This file is the **pattern catalog**, not the changelog.
