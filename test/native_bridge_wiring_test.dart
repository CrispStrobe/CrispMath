// test/native_bridge_wiring_test.dart
//
// Covers the async native/WASM bridge handshake added so the web build's
// SymEngine WASM module is actually picked up once it finishes loading.
//
// The headless test env has no native bridge (symbol lookups fail), so
// `SymbolicMathBridge()` always throws here — the same shape as a web build
// before WASM resolves. That lets us exercise the lifecycle: engines start
// in fallback, a poll that never finds a bridge settles on `unavailable`,
// and the status enum drives `nativeBridgeReady`.
