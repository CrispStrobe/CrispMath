# CrispCalc — Repair & Completion Plan

Living document. Each task: `[ ]` pending · `[~]` in-progress · `[x]` done.
Completed items are moved (with date) to `HISTORY.md`.

See `HISTORY.md` for the most recent work: 60 new unit tests covering plane,
conic, numerical helpers and full AppState persistence; the calculator
history clear button; persistent history / variables / graph functions;
and the light/dark/system theme picker.

## P1 — Open follow-ups

- [x] ~~Make `CrispCalc` repo public.~~ Done 2026-05-17 — see HISTORY.
- [ ] **Native `limit`.** The native bridge doesn't expose a `limit`
  entry point and the underlying SymEngine C API is missing one. Numerical
  one-sided / infinity limits stay as the current best effort. (Native
  `integrate` is now bound — see HISTORY.)
- [x] ~~**`flutter build macos --release`: SymEngine wrapper symbols dropped.**~~
  Fixed 2026-05-17 — see HISTORY round 13. Bridge plugin now uses an
  `+load` keepalive with an asm-clobber `DoNotOptimize` loop over every
  `flutter_symengine_*` function pointer. Release builds keep all 45
  wrapper symbols.
- [ ] **iOS smoke test.** Not run since the recent changes.

## P2 — Engine + native bridge

- [ ] **High-precision evaluation.** `SymbolicMathBridge.evaluateWithPrecision`
  / `gmpPower` / `mpfrHighPrecisionPi` still throw — wire them when the
  C++ wrapper exposes the corresponding symbols.
- [x] ~~**Matrix arithmetic end-to-end.** Confirm `det(Matrix([[…]]))`,
  `inv(...)`, `transpose(...)` round-trip cleanly through the engine
  with a release SymEngine build.~~ Done 2026-05-17 — see HISTORY
  round 16. Required a new `MatrixEvaluator` that routes matrix
  expressions through the FFI matrix bindings (SymEngine's text
  parser doesn't recognize `Matrix(...)` literals). 6/6 self-test
  checks pass in the release build; trigger them with the
  `CRISPCALC_DIAGNOSTIC=matrix` env var or via Settings → "Matrix
  self-test".

## P2 — UX polish

- [x] ~~**More translations.** German is up to date; Spanish / French
  would be cheap follow-ups.~~ Done 2026-05-17 — see HISTORY round 17.
  Full FR and ES locales (~95 strings each) plus a per-locale
  non-emptiness test suite (20 checks) so missing strings would fail
  CI rather than a runtime UI lookup.
- [x] ~~**Variable substitution dialog** — no more typing `subst(...)`.~~
  Done 2026-05-17 — see HISTORY round 14.
- [x] ~~**Plot annotations** — mark extrema and roots on the graph
  when an analysis is open.~~ Done 2026-05-17 — see HISTORY round 15.
  Toggleable from the graphing screen toolbar; uses numerical scan
  with bisection / parabolic refinement so no SymEngine round-trip
  per point.

## P3 — Long tail

- [ ] Symbolic Gauss / RREF on matrices.
- [ ] CI: GitHub Actions to run `flutter analyze` + `flutter test` on PR.
- [x] ~~History view filtering / search.~~ Done 2026-05-17 — see
  HISTORY round 14.

## Out of scope this round

- C++ implementation of symbolic `limit` and `integrate`.
- Rewriting the LaTeX↔engine parsing as a real grammar.
- Full accessibility audit.
