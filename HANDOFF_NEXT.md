# CrispCalc — handover for the next session

Pickup note from the **2026-05-29 session** (P11 R130 + R100 + R105b).
Three arcs landed: **Linux x86_64 SymEngine** (bridge v1.2.0 — the
last tier-1 platform; every native target now ships full SymEngine),
the **German Function Reference i18n** (R100 — complete DE coverage
of the ~45-entry catalog), and **R105b** per-element help popovers on
the Statistics / Sudoku / Constraints DSL screens. Prior session
(2026-05-27) cut v0.4.0 with Android + Windows.

## ⚠ Working-mode change (unchanged)

**Parallel-arc work is paused.** All edits go **directly on `main`**
in `/Volumes/backups/code/CrispCalc`. The bridge plugin work
happens on its own feature branches in
`/Volumes/backups/code/symbolic_math_bridge` per the multi-repo
arc rule (see `memory/feedback_multi_repo_arc_worktree.md`).

## State

| **main HEAD** | R130 + R100 + R105b landed; CI green; no new GH Release cut yet — see open item |
| **Tests** | **2137 pass** (1992 → 2129 via R100 DE-completeness; → 2137 via R105b popover tests) |
| **dart_csp pin** | `69a9cfb` (unchanged) |
| **bridge pin** | **`0907768`** (bridge 1.2.0 — adds Linux x86_64 `.so`) — was `931adcf` pre-session |
| **bridge main HEAD** | `0907768` (v1.2.0; `r130-linux` merged) |
| **platforms** | iOS · macOS · Android arm64-v8a · Windows x86_64 · **Linux x86_64** — all full-CAS. Web still the only CAS-less target. |

## This session — major arcs landed (2026-05-29)

### Arc A: P11 R130 — Linux x86_64 SymEngine (bridge v1.2.0)

The last tier-1 platform. Bridge branch `r130-linux` → `main`
(`0907768`). **Green on the first CI run** (`build-linux.yml`
26604981909, 19m5s) — no iteration. A hybrid of R132 (static-link
the whole math stack into one `.so`) and R131 (three-mode consumer
CMake), but simpler: a Linux `ffiPlugin` needs no registrar `.cc` /
no `flutter` linkage, so the consumer path is pure bundling and there
is no filename-collision workaround (Dart opens
`libsymbolic_math_bridge.so`, exactly what `add_library()` emits).

- vcpkg `x64-linux` static on `ubuntu-22.04` (GLIBC 2.35 baseline).
- 18.3 MB stripped `.so`, only libc/libstdc++/libm/libgcc_s dynamic.
- Committed at `linux/Libraries/`; CrispCalc re-pinned to `0907768`.
- **All 6 CrispCalc CI jobs green** — the Build Linux job moved from
  degraded to full via consumer-prebuilt bundling (no source-compile
  attempt — the v1.1.0 failure mode did NOT recur). README + PLAN +
  `LINUX_STATUS.md` updated.

### Arc B: R100 — Function Reference content i18n (German)

Was the highest-leverage UI item. The dialog localized its chrome but
read entry descriptions + example hints from the English catalog —
fixed by the worked-examples precedent: nullable
`functionRefDescription(id)` / `functionRefExampleHint(id, index)` on
`AppLocalizations`, dialog falls back to the catalog on null.

- **Complete German** coverage of all ~45 entries (every category) —
  descriptions + every hint. Terminology per German math didactics.
- Localization test enforces full DE completeness (new entry without
  DE → CI fails). Tests 1992 → **2129**.
- **FR/ES still return null** (English fallback). The mechanism + test
  are ready; finishing them is a clean follow-up (see open items).

## Smoke-test status (what's verified, what isn't)

| | Verified via CI | Real-hardware verification |
|---|---|---|
| Compile + link + symbols in export table (all 5 platforms) | ✓ | n/a |
| macOS app builds + binaries embed | ✓ | host = macOS, runtime OK |
| Android APK contains the bridge .so | ✓ | **⚠ needs arm64-v8a device/emulator** |
| Windows zip contains the bridge .dll | ✓ | **⚠ needs Windows x86_64 desktop** |
| **Linux bundle contains the bridge .so** | ✓ (consumer-prebuilt build green) | **⚠ needs a Linux x86_64 desktop** |
| iOS unchanged | ✓ | **⚠ needs an iOS device** |

The structural pipeline is end-to-end green on all five platforms.
What's NOT confirmed: the runtime FFI call from a real Android /
Windows / Linux machine. Same wrapper source that works on iOS/macOS
got compiled into each binary — if compile + link + symbol visibility
line up (verified, incl. Linux `ldd`/`.dynsym` checks), runtime should
follow. Still worth a hardware pass.

## What's open / next session pickup

### 1. **Runtime smoke-test on real hardware** (highest priority)

Still the one thing CI can't do. Now FIVE platforms have unverified
runtime FFI: Android / Windows / **Linux** (new) — plus iOS. Grab a
release artifact (or `flutter run -d <device>`), open the calculator,
type `solve(x^2 - 1, x)`, expect `[-1, 1]`. `Error: requires native
library` means the binary didn't load — most likely a filename
mismatch between what Dart's `DynamicLibrary.open` passes and what
Flutter bundled.

- **Linux**: `flutter build linux` then run the bundle; Dart opens
  `libsymbolic_math_bridge.so` (bundled from `linux/Libraries/` via
  consumer-prebuilt mode). GLIBC baseline is 2.35 — older distros may
  refuse to load.
- **Android / Windows / iOS**: as before. Note the Windows Dart
  loader opens `symbolic_math_bridge_plugin.dll` (loader line 325)
  but consumer mode bundles `libsymbolic_math_bridge.dll` — **verify
  this on real Windows hardware**; if it fails, that's the bridge
  1.2.1 fix.

If a runtime fail surfaces, iterate the bridge — add diagnostic
logging to `_openNativeLibrary()`, narrow it, push, re-pin, release.

### 2. **Finish R100 — French + Spanish Function Reference**

German is complete; the mechanism + completeness test are in place.
FR/ES currently return null (English fallback). To finish: implement
`functionRefDescription` / `functionRefExampleHint` in
`FrLocalizations` + `EsLocalizations` (same id-keyed switch/map as
`DeLocalizations`), then add `'fr'` / `'es'` to the `complete` map in
`test/function_reference_localization_test.dart` so they're held to
full coverage. Source terminology from fr/es Wikipedia + curricula.
~155 strings per locale — get native review before/after.

### 3. **Android x86_64 (emulator) and armeabi-v7a (32-bit)**

Extend the `build-android.yml` matrix. Deferred-until-demand per the
workflow comment. Each ABI is its own ~15-min build slot.

### 4. **Carry-overs from prior sessions**

- Round 95 follow-up — Statistics input pre-fill.
- `open:` / `dsl:` dispatch in Try-in-Calculator (R99 followup).
- CSP Round E.5 — `dart_csp_fzn` CLI (blocked on P4).
- P9 follow-ups (A5d / A7 / A8) — 3D Scene polish.

### 5. **Consider cutting v0.4.1**

main carries the Linux binary + R100-DE but no GH Release has been
cut. `release.yml` builds the per-platform artifacts; tag when ready.

## Hygiene reminders

- **`dart format`** before push. Format only files you touched.
- **Don't run multiple `flutter test` in parallel** — they race
  on `.dart_tool/test/incremental_kernel_*`.
- **Don't touch `.claude/`** — harness state.
- **Working on main now.** Ask before starting a feature branch
  inside CrispCalc proper. Bridge plugin still uses feature
  branches per the multi-repo rule.
- **`flutter_symengine_*` symbol-not-found lines** in
  `flutter test` stderr are expected — the test VM doesn't load
  the plugin's compiled binaries. Bridge catches the failure;
  pure-Dart tests don't depend on it.

## Quick-reference paths

### CrispCalc (`/Volumes/backups/code/CrispCalc`)

- Calculator: `lib/screens/calculator_screen.dart`
- Notepad: `lib/screens/notepad_screen.dart`
- Help-mode infrastructure: `lib/widgets/help_target.dart`,
  `history_help_modal.dart`, `module_help_dialog.dart`,
  `calculator_keypad.dart` (popover maps)
- Function Reference catalog: `lib/engine/function_reference.dart`
  (45 entries)
- Step engine: `lib/engine/step_engine.dart`
- Localization: `lib/localization/app_localizations.dart`

### symbolic_math_bridge (`/Volumes/backups/code/symbolic_math_bridge`)

- `main` HEAD: `85bfa7e` (v1.1.0)
- `src/flutter_symengine_wrapper.{c,h}` — the 749-line C wrapper
  vendored from math-stack-ios-builder (same source for Android +
  Windows; iOS/macOS use prebuilt `.xcframework` bundles)
- `android/` — Gradle module + CMakeLists + Kotlin glue
- `windows/` — Flutter Windows plugin + CMakeLists + glue
- `.github/workflows/build-android.yml` + `build-windows.yml`
- `ANDROID_STATUS.md` + `WINDOWS_STATUS.md` — per-platform
  iteration history (essential context if R130 picks up)

### math-stack-ios-builder (`/Users/christianstrobele/code/math-stack-ios-builder`)

- Canonical iOS/macOS xcframework builder. Master branch
  `34ec0fdf`. Source-of-truth for `src/flutter_symengine_wrapper.c`
  (vendored into the bridge by R131 + R132).

Good luck.
