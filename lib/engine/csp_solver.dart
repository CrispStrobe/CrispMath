// lib/engine/csp_solver.dart
//
// Thin wrapper around the dart_csp library for the two patterns the
// Analysis-hub "Constraints" module surfaces in Round A:
//
//   1. Diophantine equations: a set of named integer variables each
//      bounded to a contiguous range, plus a list of string
//      constraints (dart_csp's parser handles `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`,
//      arithmetic, etc.). Returns *all* solutions in a list.
//
//   2. Cryptarithms (SEND + MORE = MONEY): parses a `word1 op word2
//      = word3` expression, builds the standard model — each unique
//      letter is a 0..9 variable, allDifferent on all letters,
//      leading letters cannot be 0, the digit-place expansion of
//      both sides must be equal — then asks dart_csp for the unique
//      digit assignment.
//
// The wrapper exists so the UI layer doesn't take a direct dependency
// on dart_csp's Problem API and so we can swap the underlying engine
// later without rewiring the screen. It also gives us a single place
// to put the safety net (timeouts, max-solution caps).
